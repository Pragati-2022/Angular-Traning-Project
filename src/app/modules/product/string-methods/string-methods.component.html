    Slice, substr and subString difference - Syntex string.slice(start,end)
    string.substr(start,length) string.substring(start,end) Note #1:
    slice()==substring() - What does it do? slice() extracts parts of a string
    and returns the extracted parts in a new string. substr() extracts parts of
    a string, beginning at the character at the specified position, and returns
    the specified number of characters. substring() extracts parts of a string
    and returns the extracted parts in a new string. Note #2:
    slice()==substring() - Change the Original String? No (all are same) - Using
    Negative Numbers as an Argument slice() selects characters starting from the
    end of the string substr() selects characters starting from the end of the
    string substring() doesn't perform Note #4: slice()==substr() - If the First
    Argument is Greater than the Second slice() doesn't perform substr() since
    the Second Argument is NOT a position, but length value, it will perform as
    usual, with no problems substring() will swap the two arguments, and perform
    as usual - What if the Second Argument is Omitted? selects all characters
    from the start-position to the end of the string (all are same) `
